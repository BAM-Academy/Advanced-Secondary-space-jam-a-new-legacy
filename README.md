# Space Jam A New Legacy

This repository is the companion to the Learn Module - [Use basketball stats to optimize game play with Visual Studio Code, inspired by SPACE JAM: A NEW LEGACY](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/optimize-basketball-games-with-machine-learning/).  For this project, we will be leveraging machine learning to make predictions.  Machine-learning models are computer algorithms that use data to make estimations (educated guesses) or decisions. 

## Machine Learning
Machine-learning models differ from traditional algorithms in how they are designed. When normal computer software needs to be improved, people edit it. By contrast, a machine-learning algorithm uses data to get better at a specific task.
